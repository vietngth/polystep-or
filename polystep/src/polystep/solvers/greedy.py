"""Greedy solvers: deterministic update rules for ablation studies.

Provides two non-iterative solvers that bypass entropic OT entirely:

- ``MinCostGreedySolver``: Each particle moves to its single lowest-cost vertex.
- ``TopKMeanSolver``: Each particle moves to the uniform average of its k
  lowest-cost vertices.

Both produce transport matrices compatible with the standard barycentric
projection (Eq. 7) and conform to the ``Solver`` protocol.
