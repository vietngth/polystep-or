"""Vmap-compatible LSTM bypassing CuDNN.

Standard ``nn.LSTM`` (via ``aten::lstm.input``) has no batching rule under
``torch.vmap`` and fails on both CPU and CUDA -- still the case on PyTorch
2.12 (verified). This implementation uses explicit per-step gate
computations, which are vmap-safe but ~2-5x slower than CuDNN.

Example:
    >>> import torch
    >>> from polystep.layers import VmapSafeLSTM
    >>> lstm = VmapSafeLSTM(input_size=32, hidden_size=64, num_layers=2)
    >>> x = torch.randn(4, 10, 32)  # (batch, seq, input)
    >>> out, (h_n, c_n) = lstm(x)
    >>> out.shape
    torch.Size([4, 10, 64])
