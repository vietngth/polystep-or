"""Epsilon schedulers for entropic regularization decay.

Entropic regularization (epsilon) controls the smoothness of the optimal
transport plan. Higher epsilon gives a smoother, more diffuse plan (easier
to solve but less precise). Lower epsilon gives a sharper plan (closer to
exact OT but harder to solve numerically). Annealing from high to low
epsilon allows coarse-to-fine optimization.

Provides three schedulers:

- ``LinearEpsilon``: Fixed linear decay: ``eps_t = max(init - decay * t, target)``.
- ``CosineEpsilon``: Cosine annealing with optional SGDR-style warm restarts.
- ``ProgressiveEpsilon``: Feedback-driven auto-adjustment based on Sinkhorn
  solver convergence, inspired by ProgOT (Kassraie, Pooladian, Klein,
  Thornton, Niles-Weed & Cuturi, *Progressive Entropic Optimal Transport
  Solvers*, NeurIPS 2024, arXiv:2406.05061).

    until it reaches the ``target`` floor. This enables coarse-to-fine
    optimization: early iterations use high epsilon for broad exploration,
    later iterations use low epsilon for precise refinement.

    Inspired by ProgOT (Kassraie et al., NeurIPS 2024, arXiv:2406.05061):
    epsilon is adjusted from actual solver convergence behavior rather than
    a fixed schedule.

    When the solver converges quickly (few iterations), epsilon is decreased
    to sharpen the transport plan. When the solver struggles (many iterations
    or fails to converge), epsilon is increased to stabilize solving.

    The ``at()`` method is a drop-in replacement for ``LinearEpsilon.at()``,
    but ignores the ``iteration`` parameter. Instead, epsilon is driven by
    explicit ``update()`` calls from the optimizer after each OT solve.

    Attributes:
        init: Starting epsilon value.
        target: Floor value (minimum epsilon).

    Cosine annealing keeps epsilon higher for longer in the middle of training
