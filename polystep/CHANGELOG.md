# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-27

Cleanup. No public API changes.

### Changed

- `solvers/sinkhorn.py`: dropped two GPU->CPU syncs per Sinkhorn solve.
  `cost_scale` (the warm-start `clamp_` bound) stays on-device as a 0-d
  tensor, and `ent_reg_cost = <f,a> + <g,b>` resolves both inner products
  in one host transfer via `torch.stack([...]).sum().item()`. Same pattern
  applied to the low-rank convergence loop and its `err_a/err_b` marginal
  transfers.
- `_step_blockwise.py`: per-block fused-softmax `ent_cost_tensor.item()`
  calls now defer to a single `torch.stack([...]).sum().item()` after the
  per-block loop, mirroring `block_disp_terms` and `block_model_loss_terms`.
  Saves `O(num_blocks)` syncs per step in the fused-softmax path.
- `cma.py`: `update_step_size_csa` now accepts an optional pre-computed
  `p_sigma_norm`; both call sites (`_step_common.update_cma_state`,
  `_step_monolithic.step`) forward the norm they already paid for in
  `compute_heaviside_sigma`, removing one redundant `torch.norm(...).item()`
  per CMA generation.

### Fixed

- `CMAAdaptiveSubspace.rotate()` now forwards `transport_matrix`,
  `X_vertices`, and `X_current` to the wrapped `AdaptiveSubspace`, so the
  `'ot_bias'` rotation mode fires when CMA is enabled (it previously fell
  through to random rotation).
- `docs/api_overview.md`: the `PolyStepOptimizer.step` snippet used a
  zero-argument lambda; replaced with the real
  `closure(batched_params) -> losses` signature via `NNCostEvaluator`. The
  `SparseRandomProjection` example used `input_dim` / `output_dim` keyword
  args; the actual constructor takes `full_dim` / `subspace_dim`.
- Tightened two test tolerances that were 100-1000x looser than the
  solver's convergence threshold (`tests/test_numerical_stress.py` row-sum
  checks; `tests/test_ablation_solvers.py` tempered-softmax-vs-greedy
  match).

## 0.2.2 - 2026-05-21

Codebase cleanup, test modernization, and documentation correctness pass.

### Breaking

- Vertex generator API (`get_orthoplex_vertices`, `get_simplex_vertices`,
  `get_cube_vertices`) signature changed from `(dim, origin, radius)` to
  `(dim, *, radius=1.0)`. The `origin` parameter has been removed - all
  generators now produce unit-radius templates centered at the origin;
  translation is handled by the solver. This affects direct callers only;
  `PolyStep` and `PolyStepOptimizer` are unaffected.

### Fixed

- `compute_ot_weights` in `cma.py`: replaced linear softmax normalization
  with entropy-based OT weight computation matching the theoretical
  derivation.
- `@torch.inference_mode()` migration across `transform.py` (removed
  unused `import warnings`).
- README and API overview: `max_iteration` -> `max_iterations` (matching
  the actual `PolyStep` dataclass field).
- API overview: `AdaptiveSubspace` and `LinearSubspace` code snippets
  updated from stale direct constructors to the `from_layout()` factory.
- API overview: `SolverState(X=X_init)` -> `solver.init_state(X_init)`.

### Test suite

- Modernized all geometry tests to the new `(dim, radius)` API; fixed 17
  failing tests.
- Deleted duplicate `test_softmax_correctness.py` (was a copy of tests
  already in `test_softmax.py`).
- Cleaned up numbered tags and stale pre/post-fix prose across ten
  test files.
- Net: 905 collected tests across 45 files; fast-tier CI suite passes
  880 (+ 2 skipped, 23 deselected) in ~20 s.

### CI

- Removed 11 `--ignore` entries from CI (7 pointed to non-existent files,
  1 to a previously deleted file). CI now runs all non-slow, non-GPU tests
  without explicit ignores.
- Fast experiment-infrastructure tests (`test_baseline_fairness`,
  `test_nondiff_data`, `test_nondiff_models`, `test_rl_benchmarks`) are
  now included in CI (+98 tests, <2 s overhead).

## 0.2.1 - 2026-05-14

### Added

- `examples/06_loihi_snn_polystep.py`: end-to-end skeleton for a
  Loihi 2-style two-stage workflow. Stage 1 pretrains a hard-LIF
  MNIST SNN with PolyStep using `PSTORCH_CONFIGS["snn"]`. Stage 2
  adapts only the writable subset a real Loihi 2 chip exposes at
  runtime (`fc2`, per-population `vth`, and `beta`; about 1.3% of
  model parameters) under an `N(0, 1)` Gaussian input shift. Stage 2
  uses TENT-style safeguards: mixed-batch (half clean / half shifted),
  rank-8 probing on the writable subspace, and two probes per step.
  Both stages use best-test early stopping (patience 4) since
  zeroth-order test curves are noisier. Shifted-test evaluations
  share a fixed seeded noise mask across pre / post / baseline so the
  reported recovery is a paired comparison. On default settings the
  example reaches ~83% best clean accuracy and a +13 pp paired
  shift-recovery over the frozen-readout baseline with near-zero
  clean-accuracy degradation in about 17 minutes on a single GPU.
  Headline numbers shift by a few percentage points run-to-run on
  CUDA because of non-deterministic cuBLAS reductions, but the
  qualitative recovery is robust. The host loop is backend-agnostic:
  `LoihiSpikeEvaluator` is the single swap point against a Lava
  `netx` deployment path.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-14

Dependency floor lift, native fast-path adoption, and performance pass for
PyTorch 2.12.

### Changed

- Minimum Python is now 3.11 (was 3.10); minimum PyTorch is now 2.8 (was 2.4);
  NumPy floor is now `>=2.0`.
- Ruff `target-version` bumped to `py311`. Classifiers updated to advertise
  3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14.

### Performance

- `SinkhornSolver` convergence loop: batched the per-check scalar
  measurements (err_a, err_b, dual norm, Lyapunov) into a single
  device-to-host transfer, and switched the Anderson-acceleration
  Lyapunov accept gate to a device-side `torch.where`. Eliminates 4-7
  GPU-CPU syncs per `check_every` interval. Microbench (200 iter,
  n=m=512, fp32 on RTX 5090, full Anderson + adaptive omega): **490 ms
  -> 48 ms (~10x)**.
- Block-wise step (`_step_blockwise.py`): per-block displacement and
  model-loss scalars are accumulated as device tensors and reduced to
  the host once per step instead of twice per block.
- `NNCostEvaluator.evaluate` and `BatchedLinearEvaluator.evaluate` now
  use `@torch.inference_mode()` instead of `@torch.no_grad()` (matches
  the rest of `cost_nn.py`).

### Verified

- Full test suite (CPU + CUDA) green on PyTorch 2.12 / Python 3.14 / CUDA 13.0
  on RTX 5090 (sm_120).
- All five `examples/` reproduce within tolerance (≤1% accuracy / ≤5% returns).
- `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)` (default in `_compiled.py:try_compile`)
  warns on bypass in PyTorch 2.12 and will hard-error in 2.13; behavior
  documented for the next dependency lift.

### Test suite

- Consolidated overlapping test files.
- Net: 935 -> 906 collected tests across 45 files (was 49); fast-tier suite
  passes 885 (+ 2 skipped, 19 deselected) in ~21 s on RTX 5090.
